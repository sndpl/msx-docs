          This TSR  is downloaded  in BBS Roefsoft, and translates all 
          error  messages  of  MSX-BASIC 2.1  and disk-BASIC  1.0 into 
          Dutch. The effect of this is rather funny!

          This is, as was to be expected, the translation of "File not 
          found".  Actually it  should be "Bestand niet gevonden". But 
          it's comical enough without "bestand". It's also a bit weird 
          that  the   TSR  is   called  "Error  Translator",  and  not 
          "Fout Vertaler".
          
          I  hope nobody  really needs  this TSR, for the one who does 
          need  it,  can't play  a single  decent MSX-game,  and can't 
          understand any  scroll-text -  and he  can't even  read this 
          text, and so he wouldn't even know the program would exist!

          P.S. The file ET.TSR is the meant TSR and you can find it on 
          this disk.
